Educhidya - One-Stop Scholarship Destination
Contributors: Lakshya Chobdar, Riddhi Chandak, Trithi Amin

In our first year of engineering, we participated in the W-Accinge Hackathon organized by IEEE Umit and secured a spot in the top 10 with our project, Educhidya. This platform was designed to serve as a one-stop destination for Indian students to discover various scholarships across educational fields. Our team, consisting of Lakshya Chobdar, Riddhi Chandak, Trithi Amin developed Educhidya to simplify the process of finding and applying for scholarships, making it more accessible for students across India.
